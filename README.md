I'm a passionate and empathetic Software Engineer, recent graduate of the Digital Futures Software Engineering Academy with a background in Applied Behaviour Analysis and Special Needs Education. In my former profession as a Board Certified Behaviour Analyst, I saw technology breaking boundaries and changing people's lives. I would like to be part of a team that creates products aimed at improving our lives and I think technology is a way to do this at a grand scale.
